## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r murders_by_state, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
load("rda/murders.rda")
murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb, rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(abb,rate)) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat = "identity", color = "black") +
  coord_flip()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
